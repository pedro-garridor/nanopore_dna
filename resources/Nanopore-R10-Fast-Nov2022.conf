# This Shasta assembly configuration was tested under the following conditions:
#  - ONT R10 chemistry, fast mode, chimera rate around 2%.
#  - Guppy 6 basecaller with "super" accuracy.
#  - Human genome at low coverage (one flowcell, coverage around 35x).
#  - Haploid assembly.
# Under these conditions it produced a haploid assembly with N50 around 20 Mb
# and with base level accuracy limited mostly by heterozygosity 
# of the human genome.  
# This configuration might also be usable for other genomes and at higher coverage,
# but that was not tested.
